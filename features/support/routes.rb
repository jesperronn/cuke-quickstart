# routes are here to provide meaningful names in the .feature files
# you can either choose to use them or not. 
#
# Example:
#    Given I am on the home page  #will go to "/" 
#
# Fallback: if it does not make sense to make a route here, then 
# just use the url directly like this:
#
#    Given I go to "/accounts/new" 
# 
ROUTES = {
  "the home page" => "/",
  "the frontpage" => "/",
}
